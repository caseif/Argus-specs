# Argus-specs

This repository contains technical specifications for a number of custom formats used by the
[Argus game engine](https://github.com/caseif/Argus). Each specification is encompassed by a single subdirectory of this
repository which itself contains a subdirectory for each version of the respective schema. These version directories
contain a FORMAT.txt file outlining the basic parameters of the format. Formats using JSON as a base type will contain a
JSON schema file which defines the format itself.
