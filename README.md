# Argus-specs

This repository contains technical specifications for a number of custom formats used by the
[Argus game engine](https://github.com/caseif/Argus). Each specification is encompassed by a single subdirectory of this
repository which contains a FORMAT.txt file outlining the basic parameters of the format. Formats using JSON as a base
type will contain a JSON schema file which defines the format itself.
